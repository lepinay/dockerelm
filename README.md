dockerelm
=========

This is the Dockerfile to generate the image at https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/lepinay/elmlang/

This file will generate an image with the Elm platform and the whole Elm-lang.org site.

Having the Elm-lang.org site running locally is useful if you want to run and customize the interactive editor for your own needs.
